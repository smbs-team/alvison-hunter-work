          </p>
          <p>(a) Statistical Data</p>
          <p>
            To monitor use of the Site and the Apps and improve their quality,
            certain information is gathered automatically and stored in log
            files. This information includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your IP address</li>
            <li>Your operating system version</li>
            <li>Your browser version</li>
            <li>Your device information, including identifiers</li>
            <li>Internet service provider</li>
            <li>The pages you visit on our Site or Apps</li>
            <li>The length of time you spend on pages on the Site or Apps</li>
            <li>The site from which you clicked to visit our Site</li>
            <li>
              Search terms you used in search engines that resulted in you
              visiting our Site
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>(b) Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</p>
          <p>
            We may use technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, and browser
            analysis tools, to recognize you when you return to the Site and to
            help us improve the quality of our service when you visit our Site.
            We may also use cookies and related technologies to tailor our
            products and services to suit your personal interests, estimate our
            audience size, track visits to our Site and, as applicable, to
            process your requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cookie contains a unique alphanumeric identifier that websites use
            to help identify unique visitors to our Site, whether or not those
            visitors are repeat visitors, and the source of the visits. You may
            control cookies, including preventing or stopping the installation
            and storage of cookies, through your browser settings and other
            tools. Please note that certain features of our Site may not be
            available once cookies have been disabled. Please refer to the Help
            feature of your browser for information on disabling cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs),
            which are tiny invisible graphic images, in the Sites. Pixel tags
            may be used by us to count users who have visited its webpages and
            for related website statistics (for example, recording the
            popularity of certain website content and verifying system and
            server integrity).
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also collect location information, which may include precise
            location information when you permit our Services to access your
            device location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of our email or text communications to you may contain a
            “click-through URL,” which links to content on our Site. When you
            click one of these URLs, it passes information through our web
            server before you arrive at the destination web page. We track this
            click-through data to help determine interest in particular products
            and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer
            not to be tracked, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in
            emails or texts you receive from us.
          </p>
          <p>(a) Third Party Analytics</p>
          <p>
            We use applications supplied by third parties, such as Google
            Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and Apps. We also may use
            other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to
            help us improve our user experience. These devices and applications
            may use cookies, tracking pixels and other tracking technologies to
            perform their services. The analytics service providers may transfer
            information they collect or receive to third parties in case of a
            legal obligation or if a third party processes data on behalf of
            that service provider.
          </p>
          <p>(b) Do Not Track</p>
          <p>
            “Do Not Track” is a draft standard developed by the World Wide Web
            Consortium designed to allow you to set your internet search browser
            to send a signal to a website that you do not want the website
            operator to track certain browsing information about you. As this Do
            Not Track is still a draft standard, our Sites and Apps are not
            configured to respond to Do Not Track requests.
          </p>

              Social Media Plugins. Our Site or Apps may use social media
              plugins (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) to enable you to
              easily share information with others. When you visit our Site or
              use our Apps, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie
              or script on your device, enabling that operator to recognize
              individuals who have previously visited our Site or used our Apps.
              If you are logged into the social media site while browsing our
              Site or using our Apps, the social plugins allow that social media
              site to share data about your activities on our Site or Apps with
              other users of their social media site. For example, Facebook
              Social Plugins allow Facebook to show your Likes and comments on
              our pages to your Facebook friends. Facebook Social Plugins also
              allow you to see your friends’ Facebook activity on our website or
              Apps. We do not control any of the content from the social media
              plugins. For more information about plugins from social media
              sites you should refer to those sites’ privacy and
              data/information sharing statements/policies.

          <p>Safeguarding of Information</p>
          <p>
            We take a number of steps to safeguard the security of Personal
            Information obtained through our Services. For example, we maintain
            administrative, technical and physical controls to reasonably
            safeguard data from unlawful use, unauthorized access or disclosure.
            Individuals who have access to confidential and otherwise nonpublic
            data are required to maintain the confidentiality of such
            information. However, no system for safeguarding personal or other
            information is 100% secure and even though we have taken steps to
            protect your Personal Information from being intercepted, accessed,
            used or disclosed by unauthorized persons, we cannot fully eliminate
            security risks associated with the collection, use, and sharing of
            Personal Information.
